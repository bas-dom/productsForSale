## Advantage to traditional measurement

    Low cost

    Same accuracy level

    Data view and analysis when measuring

    Time of every service is the same and data is ready, no need to justify the time data after collecting every service.

    Data will be picked out automatically in the time time range, such as pick out the data when chiller is off.

    Report will be generated automatically and can be downloaded at any time when measure started.

## Disadvantage to traditional measurement

    The services are all made in China local, not so familiar in measurement market.

    No thermal imager measurement.
